# uSDX smd: An efficient and lightweight HF radio

## Still in development
This project is still in early development and is by no means complete or fully tested. If you're interested in testing or contributing, please send me an email. Feel free to open issues as you find them.

## Planned Features: 
- Light enough for backpacking (5oz without batteries, 12oz with batteries)
- Efficiency for extended operation on battery power
- Good SSB audio response (50Hz to 3kHz)
- Integrated digital modes (WSPR, JS8CALL)
- Inexpensive hardware (under $50 including PCB)
- Minimal soldering frustration (SOIC and 0805 where possible)
